# Challenges

## Challenge 1

Fetch and display todos with Get Todos API. I have included axios but you can use something else if preferred. The following should be displayed:

1. Name (i.e. what is this)
2. Done (Whether the todo is done or not)
3. Created (Date the todo is created in a readable format preferably; I have included moment if that helps)

## Challenge 2

Create a simple form where you can add a new todo. This should call the Add Todo API. Remember the list should also refresh with the updated todos.

## Challenge 3

Create a search input that lets you filter through the todos along with a button that sorts the list by alphabetical order.

## Challenge 4

Create some way to update whether or not the todo has been completed using the Update Todo API.

## Challenge 5

Finally, create some sort of button next to the list of todos so that when it is clicked a todo is deleted. Remember the list should also refresh to remove the deleted todos.
